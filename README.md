  - Azure API Management helps securely expose services hosted on and outside of Azure as APIs
  - Azure API Management is made up of an API gateway, a management plane, and a developer portal. API gateway can verify the IP range, credentials like JWT tokens and certificates presented with requests

## Prerequisites

1. An API Management instance [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance-cli)
2. An Azure AD tenant

## In order to restrict the public access with validated JWT policy in APIM, we have to customize JWT token.
## Solution 1: Register and Configure the Client and DPS Role Management Resource in AAD

1. DPS Role Management App <br />
  a Change the value [accessTokenAcceptedVersion] field from null (which defaults to: 1) to 2<br />
  b Create App role(DPS.Access)<br />
  c Expose the API and set the Application ID URI(api://xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)<br />
2. Client App<br />
  a  Create a secret (copy the secret once it is generated as you wonâ€™t be able to view it again after you leave this page)<br />
  b  Grant the Client App the permission(app role-DPS.Access) through API permission<br />
  c  Grant admin consent after create the permission<br />
  
 ## Configure APIM Instance

 1. Create APIM and test api [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish)
 2. Applying the JWT validation policy on the operation-level
   ```sh
   <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized API Call">
   <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantID}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
    <required-claims>
     <claim name="roles">
       <value>DPS.Access</value>
     </claim>
   </required-claims>
  </validate-jwt>
   ```
  
  
  ## Solution 2: Customize claims in JWT - tried to use listed three ways, non of them work so far.

  ## Postman Test
  1. Request Bearer Token [You have to use v2.0 or the app role won't show up in the token]
    POST: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantID}/oauth2/v2.0/token

  2. Pass the JWT in the [Authorization] header in another request to the APIM published API operation
